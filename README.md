# EasyCite

A simple Python script to download .bib citations and PDFs. Bibtex files pulled from [http://dx.doi.org](http://dx.doi.org/) and PDFs downloaded from SciHub using [scidownl](https://pypi.org/project/scidownl/). 

## How to use

Set up the directories you want to save the bib files and pdf directories to in `EasyCite.py`. Then execute the script. Then just copy a doi to the clipboard and press enter.
